# Sahl - Mobile Bill Payment App

This repository contains the source code for Sahl, a single-page application (SPA) prototype for a mobile bill payment service in Egypt. The project was built as a training exercise to demonstrate proficiency in front-end development with Angular and to simulate the functionality of a real-world utility payment application.
